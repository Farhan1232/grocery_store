🛒 Flutter Grocery App (Node.js Backend)

This project is a full-stack grocery mobile application built using Flutter for the frontend and Node.js (Express.js) for the backend. The app is designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly grocery shopping experience with real-time data handling and secure server-side operations.

The Flutter mobile application delivers a modern UI with fast performance and cross-platform support for Android and iOS from a single codebase. Users can browse grocery items, view product details, manage their cart, and place orders seamlessly.

The Node.js backend handles all core business logic, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and API communication. It exposes RESTful APIs that securely connect the mobile app with the server. The backend is structured for scalability and performance, making it suitable for real-world production use.

The application follows a clean architecture, ensuring proper separation between UI, business logic, and data layers. Secure API communication, structured database integration, and efficient state management are key focuses of this project.
